# Vision

Humans have the unique ability to experience and tell stories, enabling shared experiences without direct involvement. These stories polarize into two forms, narrative and vision, based on the fundamental energies of fear and love, respectively.
The liminal mind, rooted in love, views stories as living beings to be served and empowered. 
Visions emerge from this perspective, seeking to add to the beauty, truth, and goodness of reality. Unlike narratives, visions inspire and empower, fostering interconnectedness and collective intelligence. Visions encompass the full spectrum of truth, goodness, and beauty, using truth in service to goodness to deepen beauty. 
Through inspiration visions form the bedrock of the emergence and evolution of collective intelligence oriented towards the divine.
